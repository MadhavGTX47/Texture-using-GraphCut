# Texture using GraphCut

#### Libraries Used:

- Used stb single-file public domain libraries for C/C++ for image loading and writing.
> File Names: `stb_image` and `stb_image_write` belong to this.

#### Running the Code:
- To run the code using the below command, which will compile the code and generate cut.exe and it runs cut.exe with default parameters of `graph_cut input.png output.png 512x512`, to use the default command copy and input image into this folder and name the file as input.
```sh
make cut
```
- Alternatively, after running the above command you can run the code with your own parameters as 
```sh
graph_cut input_image_path output_image_path output_resolution
```
> here input_image_path output_image_path are paths to images, or just name if they are already present in the directory
and  output_resolution is given as width x height.

- To clean the output and run fresh use the command below for windows-based machines. 
```sh
make cleanw
```
And for Linux based machines. 
```sh
make cleanl
```
#### Understanding the output:
- The Output will be generated in this folder after running the commands above.
- There will be 6 Output files which are:-
* ` output.png` :- The main output image generated.
* `Overlapped.png` :- This image shows the overlapped portion for two consecutive patches which are pasted in the output canvas with the random method, which is the default method used in this (for more info on the random method please check the paper on this project was based on).
* `Segment.png` :- It shows us the min-cut of the overlapped region (including the patch which needs to be taken from the source).
* `output.png` :- The main output image generated.
* `Graph.txt` :- Here we print 3 Values of the graph generated for the overlapped region seen in `Overlapped.png` which are the first vertex and the 2nd vertex the value, here this second value can be -1 to signify that we cannot traverse further (things further don't include in our min-cut) and the edge weight which is the capacity between the two vertexes.
* `mincut.txt` :- Prints the coordinates of the mincut.

#### Extra Credit:

- Implemented Dinicâ€™s algorithm for Maximum Flow instead of Edmond Karp.
